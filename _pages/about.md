At Brookhaven National Laboratory, my focus is on pushing the boundaries of materials science through pioneering tomography and electrochemical characterization techniques. This work directly aligns with my Ph.D. studies at Stony Brook University, where I immerse myself in the intricacies of materials science and engineering.

With my master's background in materials and chemical engineering, I am committed to advancing smart, energy-efficient materials. My contributions in electrochemistry are not just academic pursuits; they are steps toward a more sustainable future, reflecting my dedication to real-world impact.
